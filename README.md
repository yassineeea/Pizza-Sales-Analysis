<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project 📚


[![Pizza Sales Analysis Screenshot](https://github.com/yassineeea/Pizza-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Pizza%20Sales%20Images/PizzaDash.png)](https://example.com)


The Pizza Sales Analysis project aimed to explore and understand sales trends, customer preferences, and performance across different pizza categories and sizes. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of pizza sales, the project sought to uncover insights that could help optimize inventory management, improve marketing strategies, and enhance overall sales performance.

#### Goals 🎯
* Identify Top Performers🥇: Determine which pizza categories and sizes contribute most to total revenue and orders.
* Analyze Sales Trends📈: Understand the daily, weekly, and monthly trends in pizza orders to optimize supply chain and marketing efforts.
* Customer Insights🕒: Identify peak order times and high-demand periods to align business strategies accordingly.



### Built With ⛏️🧑🏽‍💻
To navigate the data analyst job market, I enlisted a powerful toolkit:

- **[![SQL][SQL-badge]][SQL-url]** served as the foundation, enabling me to explore and clean database to extract valuable insights.
- **[![Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio][SSMS-badge]][SSMS-url]** Provided a familiar environment for database interaction and executing SQL queries.
- **[![Power BI][PowerBI-badge]][PowerBI-url]** Utilized for creating interactive dashboards.
- **[![Git][Git-badge]][Git-url] [![GitHub][GitHub-badge]][GitHub-url]** ensured seamless version control and collaboration by allowing me to track changes and share my SQL scripts and analysis.

<!-- Problem Statement -->
## Problem Statement 📝
### 1. KPI requirements 📌
We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:
- **Total Revenue:** The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
- **Average Order Value:** The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
- **Total Pizzas Sold:** The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
- **Total Orders:** The total number of orders placed.
- **Average Pizzas Per Order:** The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders

### 2. CHARTS REQUIREMENT 📊

We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:

- **Daily Trend for Total Orders:** Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will help us identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.

- **Monthly Trend for Total Orders:** Create a line chart that illustrates the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.

- **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:** Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Project Workflow 🚀


### 1. Data Collection and Preparation 🗂️

#### Data Source🌐: 

#### Data Cleaning🧹:

### 2. Data Analysis with SQL 🔍
#### * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)🔎:
I Performed initial data exploration using SQL queries to understand the distribution of data and identify any anomalies.
#### * KPI Calculation📊:
I Wrote SQL queries to calculate the required KPIs such as Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas Per Order.
- **1. Total Revenue:** This query calculates the sum of the total price of all pizza orders.:
```sql
SELECT SUM(total_price)
AS TotalPrice from pizza_sales;
```
- **2. Average Order Value:** This query calculates the average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
```sql
select SUM(total_price)/count(DISTINCT(order_id)) as AverageOrderValue 
from pizza_sales;
```
- **3. Total Pizza Sold:** This query calculates the sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
```sql
SELECT SUM(quantity) as TotalPizzaSold 
FROM pizza_sales;
```
- **4. Total Orders:** This query calculates the total number of orders placed.
```sql
SELECT count(distinct(order_id)) as TotalOrders 
FROM pizza_sales;
```
- **5. Average Pizza Per Order :** This query calculates
```sql
select CAST(SUM(quantity) as decimal(10,2)) / CAST(count(distinct order_id) as decimal(10,2)) 
as AveragePizzaPerOrder  
from pizza_sales;
```

#### * Trend Analysis📈:
I Used SQL to extract data for daily and monthly trends, enabling the creation of the necessary charts in Power BI.
- **1. Daily Trend of orders :** This query calculates the total number of distinct orders for each day of the week. .
```sql
SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date)  as order_date , count(distinct order_id) as totalorders     
FROM pizza_sales 
GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date);
```
- **2. Monthly Trend of orders  :** This query calculates the total number of distinct orders for each month.
```sql
SELECT DATENAME(Month, order_date)  as order_date , count(distinct order_id) as totalorders     
FROM pizza_sales 
GROUP BY  DATENAME(Month, order_date);
```
- **3. Percentages of sales per category  :** This query calculatesThis query calculates the percentage of total sales for each pizza category.
```sql
SELECT pizza_category, SUM(total_price)*100 / (select SUM(total_price)
FROM pizza_sales)  as TotalPrice 

FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_category;
```
- **4. Top 5 pizzas by revenue   :** This query calculates the total revenue for the top 5 pizza names, ordered by revenue in descending order.
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, Sum(total_price) as TotalRevenue 
FROM pizza_sales 
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;
```
### 3. Data Visualization with Power BI 📊
- **Dashboard Creation:** Leveraging Power BI, I transformed the processed data into interactive, insightful dashboards that provide a comprehensive view of pizza sales performance over time.

### 4. Business Insights and Reporting 🧠

- **Actionable Insights:** The visualized data provides actionable insights that can drive strategic decisions, such as optimizing inventory for the best-selling pizzas, revising marketing strategies for underperforming products, and adjusting pricing models based on customer demand patterns.

- **Performance Monitoring:** These dashboards enable continuous performance monitoring, allowing stakeholders to track progress against sales targets, identify potential issues early on, and respond swiftly to changes in market conditions.
